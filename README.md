## ✨ Hi, I'm Angela! ✨

#### tldr: I'm a data scientist, economist, and sci fi writer
###### other stuff I do: knitting, weightlifting, reading, parenting

- I once wrote a story about [an alternative 19th century American west where Tibetan Buddhism is _literally_ true](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-good-deaths-part-ii/).
- Big fan of knitting here.
- I work in 🐍 Python mostly, but I've journeyed through ⛪ JavaScript and 💹 Stata as well.
- I once created a programming language based on the [obscure Italian dialect my family speaks](https://github.com/angelaambroz/triestin).
- I've lived in 🛕 India (1 year), 🐘 Tanzania (2 years), 🌊 Fiji (2 years), 🍝 Italy (2 years), and ☕ the UK (2 years).
